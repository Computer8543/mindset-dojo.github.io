excerpt: "When the mind empties, body and universe become one — this is Plus Ki."
---

A student once asked,  
“Master, how do I find the flow?”  

The master poured tea into a cup — and kept pouring.  
Hot liquid spilled over the edge, scalding the student’s hand.  

“When the cup is full,” said the master,  
“there is no flow.  
When you are full of yourself,  
there is no Ki.”  

The student bowed, ashamed.  
“Then what is Plus Ki?”  

The master set down the pot.  
“When the cup empties, tea and air become one.  
When the mind empties, body and universe become one.  
This is Plus Ki.”  

The words sank like stones in still water.  
Silence gathered between them.  

“Then Plus Ki *is* the Way?” asked the student.  

The master smiled.  
“Walk it, and you will not ask.”

The student pondered long after the master had left.  
He watched steam rise from the spilled tea — soft, effortless, free.  
It did not struggle to rise; it simply rose.  

He understood.  
The Way cannot be forced.  
Flow does not come from control.  

When the mind holds, the body hardens.  
When the mind releases, the universe moves through it.  
To act with Plus Ki is not to add power — it is to let go.

**Relax completely. Keep one point. Extend Ki.**  
When these are one, the Way opens by itself.  

Not a path to find,  
but a current to remember.  

The question is never,  
“How do I find the Way?”  

The question is —  
can you empty your cup  
and feel the universe move through you?
