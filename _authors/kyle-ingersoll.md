  ### Socio-Technical Engineer

  My interest in privacy in high school ‚Äî and a growing paranoia about surveillance ‚Äî pushed me toward Linux and the principles of Free Software (inspired by Richard Stallman‚Äôs Four Essential Freedoms). I came to see software as a place to defend and extend individual agency: tools people can run, study, share, and modify. That conviction reframed technical skill as a means to protect and expand freedom, not an end in itself.

  In Community College I faced a choice between writing and computing. At root I hadn‚Äôt felt the psychological safety to write because of concerns about surveillance, so I chose computer science as a way to build safer spaces. Through Reddit‚Äôs Cloud Security Office Hours, I found a welcoming technical community and was invited by Michael to join Mindset Dojo. I didn‚Äôt connect with it at first, but returning to the Dojo ‚Äî and learning from my Zensei ‚Äî led me across thresholds where technical mastery and conversational presence fused. Mindset Dojo eventually gave me the brave space to write again; today I publish Insight pieces that bridge reflection and engineering.

  Internships at Richmond Community Schools and the Boys & Girls Club of Wayne County grounded those ideas in service. At Richmond I learned readiness ‚Äî protecting classroom systems so learning could continue. At the Boys & Girls Club I learned resilience ‚Äî treating each patch or safeguard as an act of care. Those experiences shifted my aim: not to be the most-skilled hacker, but to be a conscientious engineer who understands the moral weight of design decisions.

  Now I merge security, software freedom, and conversational practice: building safe DevOps pipelines, enforcing automated quality gates, and writing to create shared understanding. My highest goal is to protect and expand human freedom through sociotechnical engineering ‚Äî because the true value of a system is not cleverness, but how wisely and justly it serves the people who depend on it.
