  ### Socio-Technical Engineer

  My interest in privacy in high school ‚Äî and a growing suspicion of surveillance ‚Äî pulled me toward Linux and the principles of Free Software. Early on I saw software as a place to defend individual agency: tools people can run, study, share, and modify. That belief planted the seed that technical skill should serve freedom, not status.

  In Community College, I stood at a fork: writing or computing. At the time I still craved mastery over machines ‚Äî and, I now recognize, the quiet power that comes with it ‚Äî even if I didn‚Äôt want to admit that drive. I chose computer science, learning to program as a way to gain control and competence. It wasn‚Äôt yet a moral project; it was the beginning of an apprenticeship in craft and consequence.

  Through Reddit, I found Cloud Security Office Hours, a humble, helpful community, and was invited by [Michael](/_authors/michael-basil) into Mindset Dojo. I didn‚Äôt connect at first, but returning again and again ‚Äî and learning from my Zensei ‚Äî helped me fuse technical precision with conversational presence. Dojo gave me a brave space to write again and to move from mastery for its own sake toward mastery in service of others.

  Internships at Richmond Community Schools and the Boys & Girls Club of Wayne County turned ideas into practice. Protecting classroom and community networks taught me readiness and resilience ‚Äî that each patch, policy, and pipeline is an act of care. Those experiences completed the arc: I stopped pursuing hacker prestige and started treating design choices as moral responsibilities.

  Today I combine security, Free Software values, and conversational practice: building safe DevOps pipelines, enforcing automated quality gates, and writing Insight pieces ‚Äî all in service of one mission: to protect and expand human freedom through sociotechnical engineering.
