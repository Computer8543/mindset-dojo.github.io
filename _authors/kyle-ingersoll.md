  ### Socio-Technical Engineer

  My journey in technology began with a fascination for privacy and a healthy paranoia about surveillance in high school ‚Äî questions that led me to Linux and the freedom to understand how systems really work. In Community College, I reached a crossroads between writing and computing. I chose computer science, realizing that programming was another form of storytelling ‚Äî one where logic could serve empathy.

  Through Reddit, I discovered Cloud Security Office Hours, a welcoming cybersecurity community that deepened my understanding of cloud defense. There, I was invited by Michael to join Mindset Dojo, an open-source project focused on conversational mastery and growth. I didn‚Äôt connect with it at first, but returning to it again and again revealed deeper lessons ‚Äî crossing threshold after threshold until technical mastery and self-awareness became part of the same practice.

  Along the way, my internships at Richmond Community Schools and the Boys & Girls Club of Wayne County grounded those lessons in service. At Richmond, I learned readiness ‚Äî keeping classrooms connected so learning could continue securely. At the Boys & Girls Club, I learned resilience ‚Äî that every safeguard is an act of care. Those experiences shifted my goal from being the most skilled hacker to being a conscientious engineer ‚Äî one who understands the moral weight of their design decisions.

  Now, through my work in Mindset Dojo, I merge technical precision with conversational presence, helping engineer DevOps pipelines and automated safeguards that teach ethics through design itself. Across everything I do runs a single thread: drive with purpose, resilience through reflection, and responsibility in service. I don‚Äôt seek to outsmart threats ‚Äî I seek to build systems and communities that make people safer, wiser, and more connected.
