  ### Socio-Technical Engineer

  My interest in privacy in high school ‚Äî and a growing paranoia about surveillance ‚Äî pushed me toward Linux and the principles of Free Software. That early conviction reframed technical skill as a means to protect and expand individual freedom: skill in service of agency, not status.

  In Community College, I chose computer science over writing because I wanted to build tools that empower people rather than silence them. Through Reddit‚Äôs Cloud Security Office Hours I found a welcoming community and was invited by Michael into Mindset Dojo. I didn‚Äôt connect at first, but returning to the Dojo and learning from my Zensei helped me fuse technical precision with conversational presence ‚Äî and gave me the brave space to write again.

  Internships at Richmond Community Schools and the Boys & Girls Club of Wayne County turned my principle into practice. There I learned readiness and resilience ‚Äî that keeping classrooms and community networks safe is an act of care. Those experiences matured my purpose: rather than chasing accolades as a hacker, I learned to treat design decisions as moral choices and to build systems that protect people‚Äôs freedoms.

  Today I merge security, software freedom, and conversational practice: building safe DevOps pipelines, enforcing automated quality gates, and writing Insight pieces ‚Äî all toward one mission: to protect and expand human freedom through sociotechnical engineering.
