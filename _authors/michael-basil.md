  ### Leadership üå± Culture ‚òØ Technology
  
  I never expected taming parrots and navigating soccer scrums to lead me to
  coaching leaders‚Äîbut looking back, it makes perfect sense.

  Growing up in my mom‚Äôs parrot shop, I learned early to read patterns of tension
  and trust by calming unruly macaws as I relaxed into edge zones. On the soccer
  pitch, I found rhythm in motion‚Äîshifting fluidly between opportunistic striker
  and lockdown defender. Later, I trained for elegant simplicity with a computer
  engineering degree from the University of Illinois and spent my early career
  driving Agile and technology-driven transformation initiatives across complex
  organizations.

  Through a series of deeply challenging personal and professional lessons, I came to see that trying to control everything‚Äîinside or out‚Äîwas itself the obstacle. What once felt like strength revealed itself to be deeply limiting. Letting go‚Äîand simultaneously allowing for connection‚Äîbecame the real discipline. In that space, I began to understand the human factor: the invisible networks of emotion, energy, and attention that shape how we relate, decide, and lead.

  Mindset Dojo and MetaShift Method emerged from that awareness‚Äîcentered on cultivating Conversational Presence when it matters most and meeting people at the level of depth that aligns to bring real value.

  Over time, my technical lineage in computer engineering, enterprise software, and identity innovation (including a U.S. patent) integrated with this human-systems focus. What‚Äôs formed is a method for cultivating trust, precision, and agility across secure technical systems and human systems‚Äîequally applicable in code review, incident response, post-mortem reflection, organizational change, or difficult family conversations.

  I‚Äôm especially drawn to helping early-stage startups, scaling leadership teams, and organizations in moments of reinvention‚Äîthose inflection points where technical complexity and human tension meet and clarity becomes a competitive advantage.
