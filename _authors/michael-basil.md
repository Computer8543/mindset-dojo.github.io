about: |
  I never expected taming parrots and navigating soccer scrums to lead me to
  coaching leaders‚Äîbut looking back, it makes perfect sense.

  Growing up in my mom‚Äôs parrot shop, I learned early how to calm unruly
  macaws. On the soccer pitch, I found rhythm in motion‚Äîshifting fluidly
  between opportunistic striker and lockdown defender. Later, I trained for
  elegant simplicity with a computer engineering degree from the University of
  Illinois and spent my early career driving Agile and technology-driven
  transformation initiatives across complex organizations.

  Through a series of deeply challenging personal and professional lessons, I
  came to see that trying to control everything‚Äîinside or out‚Äîwas itself the
  obstacle. What once felt like strength revealed itself to be deeply limiting.
  Letting go‚Äîand simultaneously allowing for connection‚Äîbecame the real
  discipline. In that space, I began to understand the human factor: the
  invisible networks of emotion, energy, and attention that shape how we relate,
  decide, and lead.

  Mindset Dojo and MetaShift Method emerged from that awareness‚Äîcentered on
  cultivating Conversational Presence when it matters most and meeting people at
  the level of depth that aligns with what brings real value.
