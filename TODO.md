## Contributing to Mindset Dojo

Thank you for your interest in contributing! To keep things smooth and efficient, please follow these simple steps:

1. **Find something to work on**  
   - Browse [open issues]([https://github.com/mindset-dojo/mindset-dojo.github.io/issues]) and comment to claim one.  
   - If you’ve found a bug or have a feature idea, open a new issue first.

2. **Fork & Branch**  
   ```bash
   # Fork the repo, then:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mindset-dojo.git
   cd mindset-dojo
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/brief-description
   ```

3. **Develop & Test**  
   - Follow existing code patterns and naming conventions.  
   - Keep your changes small and focused.  
   - Add or update tests as needed.  
   - Ensure linting/style checks pass (e.g. ESLint, Prettier, etc.).

4. **Commit & Push**  
   - Write clear, concise commit messages:  
     ```
     feat: add X feature to improve Y
     fix: resolve Z bug causing W
     ```
   - Push your branch to your fork:  
     ```bash
     git push origin feature/your-feature-name
     ```

5. **Open a Pull Request**  
   - Base branch: `main` ← compare branch: your feature/fix  
   - In the PR description, reference related issue(s): “Closes #123”  
   - Describe what you’ve done and why; screenshots or test results are welcome.

6. **Review & Iterate**  
   - Be responsive to feedback.  
   - Make requested changes on the same branch; they’ll appear automatically in your PR.

7. **Merge & Celebrate**  
   Once approved and all checks pass, your PR will be merged. Thanks for making Mindset Dojo better!
