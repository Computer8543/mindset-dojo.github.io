# Contributing to Mindset Dojo ‚õ©Ô∏èüåø

Welcome to Mindset Dojo. This project is both technical and transformational, reflecting a deeper rhythm of inner practice, community learning, and social contribution. Contributing here means participating in an evolving dojo‚Äînot just a code repository.

## ü•ã Before You Contribute

We welcome:
- Suggestions via Issues
- Practice reflections and insights shared externally (e.g. Medium)
- Documentation, design, or structural improvements

**Pull Requests (PRs)** are open to all, but deeper integration happens through practice. Before taking on core roles or becoming a regular contributor, we ask that you first:

- Complete at least **Gray Belt level** in the [Mindset Dojo Program](https://dojo.center/program)
- Understand our rhythm, principles, and tone of engagement

This helps ensure alignment between our inner work and our outward contributions.

## Principles of Practice

In this dojo, our work is not just technical ‚Äî it is a shared practice.  The following principles guide how we contribute and collaborate together:

- **Focus & Smallness** ‚Äî Aim each issue or change at a single clear intention and keep work bite-sized. Small, focused contributions make learning and review easier.
- **State Intention** ‚Äî Say *why* you‚Äôre doing something before you do it. Use a short user story (e.g., ‚ÄúAs a member‚Ä¶, I want‚Ä¶, so that‚Ä¶‚Äù) in the Issue or Pull Request description to reveal the value behind the change. A clear intention guides better execution and kinder feedback.
- **Calm, Human Reviews** ‚Äî Assume good intent; give specific, curious, and modest feedback. Reviews are for learning together, not scoring points.
- **Open Stewardship & Clear Trail** ‚Äî Be transparent while respecting stewardship: welcome participation, let roles form through practice, and keep history readable (we use Conventional Commits to help with that).

### How We Review

Reviews are an extension of practice ‚Äî a chance to grow together.  We aim to:
- respond with clarity and curiosity,
- offer specific suggestions rather than judgments,
- remain modest and open to being changed by another‚Äôs point of view.

### Joining the Community

If you‚Äôre new here, you‚Äôre welcome to reach out to an existing member when starting your first contribution.  There is no formal mentorship structure ‚Äî simply a space for connection and shared learning.  Let the conversation grow naturally, and see what emerges.

## üîÑ PR Guidance

1. **Fork** the repository and create a topic branch.
2. Use **Conventional Commits** in your messages.
3. Submit a **clear, minimal PR** and link any relevant issues.
4. Any PR will be vetted through the automated GitHub Action-based quality gates.
5. Contributors with roles may help review or refine the PR.
6. Merge happens through mutual discernment‚Äîtechnical *and* energetic fit matter.

### Who merges?

- Whoever is initiating the change should merge if they have permissions.
- When the initiator does not have permission then the approver should merge.
- When there are issues with the build of the site post-merge that were not caught by quality gates (human and automated) reach out liberally to Trusted Committers, Project Maintainers and Organizational Owners with a bias to who is perceived to have the most context about the effect of the change.
