  I never expected taming parrots and navigating soccer scrums to lead me to
  coaching leaders—but looking back, it makes perfect sense.

  I grew up in my mom’s parrot shop, calming unruly macaws. On the soccer
  pitch, I learned to move fluidly between opportunistic striker and lockdown
  defender. Later, I trained for elegant simplicity with a computer engineering
  degree from the University of Illinois and spent my early career shaping
  Agile, DevOps, and observability practices across complex organizations—
  helping teams build systems that could sense, adapt, and grow.

  Through a series of deeply challenging personal and professional lessons, I
  came to see that trying to control everything—inside or out—was itself the
  obstacle. What once felt like strength revealed itself as tension. Letting
  go—and simultaneously allowing for connection—became the real discipline. In
  that space, I began to understand the human factor: the invisible networks of
  emotion, energy, and attention that shape how we relate, decide, and lead.

  Mindset Dojo emerged from that awareness: a practice ground for fearless
  leadership, where we train the human factor at the heart of performance—and
  develop the gut-level intelligence to stay centered in the moments that
  matter most.
engagements:
  - label: Training Sessions
    description: >
      Immersive sessions exploring the human factor of leadership through the
      Mindset Dojo approach—MetaShift Method, Zen Leadership, and Conversational
      Presence. Each session blends reflection, dialogue, embodied practice, and
      Agile flow to build energy agility and composure under pressure.
  - label: Scoped Engagements
    description: >
      Targeted collaborations that unite Agile transformation with human systems
      design. Work may include leadership team calibration, cultural
      retrospectives, or technology-to-human workflow integration. Drawing on
      software engineering, DevSecOps, and AI practice, we align people,
      process, and product toward adaptive, ethical growth.
  - label: Resident Expert
    description: >
      Medium-term residencies—one or more days per week—supporting organizations
      through scaling or reinvention. Combines technical depth (secure software
      delivery, cloud architecture, AI ethics) with human-factor leadership
      development. Ideal for early-stage or evolving teams seeking coherence
      across systems, culture, and communication.
