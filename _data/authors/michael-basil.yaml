biosketch: |
  I never expected taming parrots and navigating soccer scrums to lead me to
  coaching leaders—but looking back, it makes perfect sense.

  I grew up in my mom’s parrot shop, calming unruly macaws. On the soccer
  pitch, I learned to move fluidly between opportunistic striker and lockdown
  defender. Later, I trained for elegant simplicity with a computer engineering
  degree from the University of Illinois and spent my early career shaping
  Agile, DevOps, and observability practices across complex organizations—
  helping teams build systems that could sense, adapt, and grow.

  Over time, I realized the systems most in need of transformation weren’t
  technical—they were human. Mindset Dojo grew from that awareness: a practice
  ground for fearless leadership, where we train mind, body, tone, and timing
  as one. My focus now is helping leaders and teams cultivate clarity and
  composure under pressure, so presence becomes their natural way of leading.
engagements:
  - label: Training Sessions
    description: >
      Interactive sessions practicing Mindset Dojo Approach—MetaShift Method,
      Zen Leadership, and Conversational Presence through energy agility. 
      Each session blends dialogue, reflection, and embodied exercise to
      cultivate awareness, adaptability, and composure under pressure.
  - label: Scoped Engagements
    description: >
      Focused collaborations that integrate Agile transformation, leadership
      development, and technical evolution. Scoped work may include system
      design reviews, Agile delivery coaching, or cultural calibration within
      technology teams. Drawing on experience in software engineering, DevSecOps,
      and AI integration, these engagements align people, process, and product
      toward adaptive, secure, and sustainable growth.
  - label: Resident Expert
    description: >
      Medium-term residencies—one or more days per week—providing embedded
      expertise during periods of scaling or reinvention. Combines technical
      depth (secure software delivery, cloud architecture, and AI ethics) with
      cultural transformation guidance (Agile leadership, communication design,
      community practice). Ideal for early-stage or evolving organizations
      seeking to mature systems and culture in parallel without losing coherence.
