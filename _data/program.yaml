rally: Fearless Leadership
mantra: "Don't Complain. Train."
mission:
  - Our mission is to plant the seed of fearlessness in homes, classrooms, dojos, and boardrooms.
  - We train not just the mind, but the body, tone, and timing that cultivate presence under pressure.
context:
  intro_lines:
    - "When the pressure hits, you don’t rise to the level of your best intentions."
    - "You reveal the level of your conditioning."
  scenario_lines:
    - "In the middle of a hard conversation…"
    - "When trust is on the line…"
    - "In that flash between stimulus and response…"
  pullquote: "The body speaks, not the polished script."
  why_we_train:
    - "Because awareness isn’t enough — you can name the pattern and still fall into it."
    - "Because in high-stakes moments, you won’t have time to think — only time to respond."
    - "Because pressure doesn’t reveal your potential — it reveals your practice."
  practice_bullets:
    - "We practice live, in real conversations — where timing, tone, and tension are felt."
    - "We reflect between reps — using voice notes to recalibrate and deepen awareness."
    - "We progress with purpose — using a belt path that honors embodied thresholds."
