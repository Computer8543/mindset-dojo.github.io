rally: Fearless Leadership
mantra: "Don't Complain. Train."
statement:
  - Our mission is to cultivate fearless presence through energy agility.
  - To plant this practice in homes, classrooms, dojos, and boardrooms.
  - Training mind, body, breath, tone, and timing as one field.
  - So composure becomes natural when pressure arrives.
context:
  scenario_lines:
    - "When the pressure hits, you don’t rise to the level of your best intentions."
    - "You reveal the level of your conditioning."
    - "..."
    - "In the middle of a stuck conversation…"
    - "When trust is on the line…"
    - "In that flash between stimulus and response…"
  pullquote: "We speak in energy, not blame—the body speaks before the script."

  why_we_train:
    - "Because awareness alone can’t change a reflex—it must be retrained."
    - "Because under stress, thought disappears and energy decides."
    - "Because pressure doesn’t reveal potential—it reveals practice."

      - "..."
      - "Money is one form of energy—vital for scale, not for entry."
      - "If not financial, invest time, attention, mentorship, or expertise."
      - "Those with means extend reach; those with practice deepen it."
