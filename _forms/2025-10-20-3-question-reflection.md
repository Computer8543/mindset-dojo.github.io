## Intention

Reflect in a Mat session about your experiences through answering 3 calibrated questions for your assigned group. This will help distill what you are learning and improve inner alignment.

## Experience

You center with intention to meet fear with presence. After doing so, you relax completely due to the playful resonance of the group. Following this exercise is a good time to consider authoring an Insight post.

## Implementation

Find a willing Circle, engage the Mat, and begin the session. After checking in and centering, work through the three calibrated questions. Doing so allows the group to share their answers and to collectively learn.
