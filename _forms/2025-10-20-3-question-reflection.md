## Intention

Reflect in a Mat Breakout session about your experiences through answering 3 calibrated questions with your assigned group.

## Guidance

### What you will experience

You center with intention to meet fear with presence. After doing so, you relax completely due to the playful resonance of the group.

### How to implement it yourself

Find a willing Circle, bring in a Mat, and begin the session. After introducing yourself and the Dojo you came from, relax the tension by playing 4 Element Zensei. Split the Circle into breakup rooms. Then ask each person in the room to answer 3 calibrated questions about their experiences and share their answers with the group. Doing so allows the group to collectively learn from each other, deepening the experience. Finally, reunite the Circle and ask them to share their answers with each other.
