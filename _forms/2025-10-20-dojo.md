## Intention

A Dojo is a Circle of learning that embodies the Way through the Mat, integrating both Yin and Yang energies. The Zensei leads, Zenpais guide and model, and Zohais follow.

## Guidance

### What you will experience

You will experience a playfully serious resonance that will cause you to relax completely. Entering the Dojo, you center with intention to meet fear with presence.

### How to implement it yourself

One brings a Mat to a Circle, thus making a Dojo. To be more precise, one infuses and leads a Circle with a playfully serious resonance and centers with intention to meet fear with presence causing Circle members to relax completely. One should be at the Zensei level before creating one, since you will ultimatly bear responsiblity as Zojocho for the actions of your Dojo's members. The buck stops with you.
