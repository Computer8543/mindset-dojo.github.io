## Intention

A Dojo is a Circle of learning that embodies Fearless Leadership through practicing MetaShift Method on a Mat. The Zensei, Zenpai, and Zohai model and guide and follow as it makes sense for their level of learning and responsibility.

## Experience

You will experience a playfully serious resonance that will invite you to relax completely. Entering the Dojo, you center with intention to meet fear with presence.

## Implementation

One engages the Mat within the Circle, thus making a Dojo. To be more precise, one infuses and leads a Circle with a playfully serious resonance and centers with intention to meet fear with presence inviting Circle members to relax completely and deepen the training.
