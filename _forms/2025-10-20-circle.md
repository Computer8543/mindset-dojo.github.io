## Intention

Circle Communities are brave spaces for mutual exploration and reflection. They are the Yin to the Mat's Yang.

## Guidance

### What you will experience

You will feel safe to share your insights while communicating with people and have deep sustained conversations that matter.

### How to implement it yourself

Start with a few people you trust, then invite friends they trust. Webs of trust build the foundation of psychological safety that Circles are built off of. When built, centering with intention and then meeting fear with presence is Ki. That sustains the relational energy field and creates the conditions for relaxing completely and having a playful community resonance.
