## Intention

The Way is the path to the Universal one follows to gain and embody the insights one gains through enlightenment. Guiding people on that path is the purpose of the Dojo.

## Guidance

### What you will experience

While following the Way, one experiences both relaxation after confronting fear with presence and an ever increasing assault on one's Ego. This lasts until the Ego becomes one's tool, not one's tyrant. This allows one to be attuned to universal resonance, and to live in the Enlightenment stage of the Map of Consciousness most of the time.

### How to implement it yourself

One can follow the way on their own through many different paths. One should ideally have the guidance of a Zensei that they trust, since the process of following the Way attacks one's very perception and identity.
