## Intention

A Mat is a brave attitude one brings with them to do mutual (Jungian) shadow integration through embodied practice. That attitude is a playful one that meets fear with presence. It is the Yang to the Circle's Yin.

## Guidance

### What you will experience

You will center with intention to meet fear with presence. Meeting fear with presence will allow you to relax completely and have playful resonance.

### How to implement it yourself

One can train on a Mat by themselves or collectively in a Circle. Both types of training require calibrated questions to find stuck points, dynamic silence to invite the other to answer honestly, and paraphrasing what they said to ensure mutual understanding. Again, Webs of Trust are Ki to doing this training safely.
