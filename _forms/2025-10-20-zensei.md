## Intention

A Zensei fearlessly leads Zenpai and Zohai along the Way. They lead Mat sessions and author Insights regularly.

## Guidance

### What you will experience

You will experience a playfully serious resonance that will cause you to relax completely. You center an entire Circle with intention to meet fear with presence.

### How to implement it yourself

To be a Zensei, one must have passed the Black Level Threshold and have Zen Leadership Instructor Designation. Teach Zenpai and Zohai what you know about Fearless Leadership and the Way in Mat sessions through calibrated questions and meeting them where they are at.
