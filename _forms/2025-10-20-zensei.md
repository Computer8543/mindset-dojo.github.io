## Intention

A Zensei fearlessly leads through modeling, guidance, and support through MetaShift Method. They lead Mat sessions and author Insights regularly.

## Experience

You will experience a playfully serious resonance that will cause you to relax completely. You center yourself and your fellow peers with intention to meet fear with presence so that you expand as a Self-Author and Zensei.

## Implementation

To be a Zensei, one must have passed the Black Level Threshold and have Zen Leadership Instructor Designation. Teach Zenpai and Zohai what you know about Fearless Leadership and MetaShift Method in Mat sessions.
