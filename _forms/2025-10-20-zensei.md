## Intention

A Zensei fearlessly leads through modeling, guidance, and support along The Way. They lead Mat sessions and author Insights regularly.

## Experience

You will experience a playfully serious resonance that will cause you to relax completely. You center yourself and your fellow peers with intention to meet fear with presence so that you expand as a Self-Author and Zensei.

## Implementation

To be a Zensei, one must have passed the Black Level Threshold and have Zen Leadership Instructor Designation. Teach Zenpai and Zohai what you know about Fearless Leadership and The Way in Mat sessions through MetaShift Forms.
