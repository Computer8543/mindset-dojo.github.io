## Intention

The love child of Elemental FEBI, 4 Patterns, and Simon Says. Meant to integrate left and right halves of the brain, allowing one to embody energy agility through practicing the 4 Patterns through motion.

## Guidance

### What you will experience

You center with intention to have playful resonance. You will relax completely through meeting fear with presence.

### How to implement it yourself

Find a Circle, bring in a Mat, and begin the game. The Zensei picks either the Elemental (Fire, Water, Earth, Air) or FEBI (Driver, Collaborator, Organizer, Visionary) version of the 4 Patterns. The rest of the Circle in the Mat session follows the lead of the Zensei and imitates them. The Zensei then names another member of the Circle, the Zensei, while naming the Pattern they want the group to imitiate. This cycle repeats until everyone in the Circle has been Zensei twice.
