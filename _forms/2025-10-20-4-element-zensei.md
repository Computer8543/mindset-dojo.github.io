## Intention

The love child of Elemental FEBI™, 4 Patterns, and Simon Says. Meant to integrate both left and right brain mode thinking into the body's nervous system. This allows one to embody energy agility through practicing the 4 Patterns through motion.

## Experience

You center with intention to have playful resonance. You will relax completely as you will learn your energy edges and limits. Following this exercise is a good time to practice 3 Question Reflection.

## Implementation

Find a Circle, engage the Mat, and begin the game. The Zensei picks either the Elemental (Fire, Water, Earth, Air) or FEBI™ (Driver, Collaborator, Organizer, Visionary) version of the 4 Patterns. The rest of the Circle in the Mat session follows the lead of the Zensei and imitates them. The Zensei then names another member of the Circle, the Zensei, while naming the Pattern they want the group to imitiate. This cycle repeats until everyone in the Circle has been Zensei twice.
