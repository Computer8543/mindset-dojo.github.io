## Intention

A Zenpai learns from the model and guidance of the Zensei, and acts as a guide and model for the Zohai through The Way. They occasionally lead Mat sessions and author Insights.

## Experience

You will experience a playfully serious resonance that will invite you to relax completely. You center yourself and your fellow peers with intention to meet fear with presence so that you expand as a Self-Author and Zenpai.

## Implementation

To be a Zenpai, one must have passed through the Blue Level Threshold. Teach Zohai and other Zenpai what you know about Fearless Leadership and The Way in Mat sessions through MetaShift Forms.
