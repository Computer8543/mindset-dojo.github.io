## Intention

A Zenpai follows the Zensei, and acts as a guide and model for Zohai along the Way.  They occasionally lead Mat sessions and author Insights.

## Guidance

### What you will experience

You will experience a playfully serious resonance that will cause you to relax completely. You center an entire Circle with intention to meet fear with presence.

### How to implement it yourself

To be a Zenpai, one must have passed the Blue Level Threshold. Teach Zohai and other Zenpai what you know about Fearless Leadership and the Way in Mat sessions through calibrated questions and meeting them where they are at.
