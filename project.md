## Open Source Infrastructure

The [Site]({{'/' | relative_url}}) is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/), a platform where communities build and improve software together in the open.

The Mindset Dojo infrastructure is built as an [Open Source](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source) project, which means anyone can see how it works, suggest improvements, and even contribute directly.

We‚Äôve released the Mindset Dojo site under an **Open Source [License]({{'/LICENSE' | relative_url}})**, which simply means the code and content is shared freely for anyone to learn from, use, or improve with proper attribution ‚Äî much like leaving the workshop door open so the whole community can join in.

## üí° Principles of Practice

In this dojo, contributing is not only about building a site ‚Äî it is about *shared practice*.  
Here are the principles we keep close:

* üéØ **Keep it simple and clear** ‚Äî Focus each change on one thing at a time. Small, clear steps are easier to learn from.  
* üß≠ **Share your intention** ‚Äî Let others know *why* you‚Äôre doing something. A short note like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm updating the menu so it‚Äôs easier to navigate‚Äù helps everyone understand the value.  
* ü§ù **Review with kindness** ‚Äî Assume good intent. Be specific, curious, and respectful in feedback. Reviews are for learning together.  
* üõ°Ô∏è **Work openly** ‚Äî Be transparent, welcome others in, and keep changes easy to follow. We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) to keep history clear.  

### ‚úÖ How We Review

* Respond with clarity and curiosity  
* Offer suggestions, not judgments  
* Stay open to learning from each other  
* Treat reviews as shared practice  

### ü§ù Joining the Community

If you‚Äôre new, don‚Äôt worry ‚Äî you don‚Äôt have to figure it out alone. Reach out to a member when making your first contribution. There‚Äôs no formal mentorship program, but informal support and pairing are common here. We learn and grow together.

## ü•ã Agile Natured Contribution
  
You don‚Äôt have to be technically savvy ‚Äî contributions can be as simple as:

* üí¨ Sharing **suggestions** in our GitHub [Issues]({{site.repo_url}}/issues)  
* ‚úçÔ∏è Writing about your **practice reflections and insights** on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) or [Medium](https://medium.com/)  
* üß© Helping with **design, writing, or small improvements** to the site

We are inspired by lightweight practices and process to keep innovation flowing;

* Project flow is inspired by [Kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development)):
  * Cards in a state of ***TODO***
    * *Open* [Issues]({{site.repo_url}}/issues) without assignment
    * *Draft* [Pull Requests]({{site.repo_url}}/pulls) without assignment
  * Cards in a state of ***In Progress***
    * *Open* [Issues]({{site.repo_url}}/issues) with at least one person who has assigned themself
    * *Draft* or *Open* [Pull Requests]({{site.repo_url}}/pulls) with at least one person who has assigned themself
  * Cards in a state of ***Done***
    * *Closed* [Issues]({{site.repo_url}}/issues) which have resulted in the realization of desired future state
    * *Closed* [Pull Requests]({{site.repo_url}}/pulls) which have resulted in the realization of desired future state
  * Cards in a state of ***Cancelled***
    * *Closed* [Issues]({{site.repo_url}}/issues) which did not come to fruition
    * *Closed* [Pull Requests]({{site.repo_url}}/pulls) which did not come to fruition
* Cards are collectively created and refined inspired by [User Story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story) form
* We embody [Empirical Principles](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/three-pillars-empiricism-scrum) performing a weekly inspection in a hour long Mat session:
  1. [One Breath](https://vimeo.com/944618879/47e96945a4) and [Two Sides](https://vimeo.com/944663134/d4f1c4f333)
  2. Review of [Issues]({{site.repo_url}}/issues) and [Pull Requests]({{site.repo_url}}/pulls) to calibrate priority and intention
  3. 10-15 minutes of [Zazen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qf1vmcP7otk)
  4. Finalize refinements and commitments

If you‚Äôd like to go deeper ‚Äî stepping into leadership opportunities or regular contributions ‚Äî we invite you to first:

* Explore at least the ***Gray Level*** of the [Program]({{'/program' | relative_url}})  
* Get a feel for our **rhythm, principles, and tone**  

This keeps our inner practice aligned with what we create together.

Contributions are always welcome and voluntary ‚Äî and just as kindly, the community may choose which ones to accept, keeping the spirit and direction of the dojo in harmony.
