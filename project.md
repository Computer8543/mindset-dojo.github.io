## Open Source Infrastructure

The [Site]({{'/' | relative_url}}) is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/), a platform where communities build and improve software together in the open.

The Mindset Dojo infrastructure is built as an [Open Source](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source) project, which means anyone can see how it works, suggest improvements, and even contribute directly.

We’ve released the Mindset Dojo site under an **Open Source [License]({{'/LICENSE' | relative_url}})**, which simply means the code and content is shared freely for anyone to learn from, use, or improve with proper attribution — much like leaving the workshop door open so the whole community can join in.

## Agile Natured Contribution
  
You don’t have to be technically savvy — contributions can be as simple as:

* Sharing **suggestions** in our GitHub [Issues]({{site.repo_url}}/issues)  
* Writing about your **practice reflections and insights** on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) or [Medium](https://medium.com/)  
* Helping with **design, writing, or small improvements** to the site

We are inspired by lightweight practices:

* Project flow is inspired by [Kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development))
* Cards are collectively created and refined inspired by [User Story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story) form
* [Empirical Inspection](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/three-pillars-empiricism-scrum) occurs weekly in a Cultivator-only Mat session

Contributions are welcome and voluntary; the community accepts those that align with the dojo’s harmony and direction.

## Principles of Contribution

In this dojo, contributing is not only about building a site — it is about *shared practice*.  
Here are the principles we keep close:

* **Keep it simple and clear** — Focus each change on one thing at a time. Small, clear steps are easier to learn from.  
* **Share your intention** — Let others know *why* you’re doing something. A short note like “I’m updating the menu so it’s easier to navigate” helps everyone understand the value.  
* **Review with kindness** — Assume good intent. Be specific, curious, and respectful in feedback. Reviews are for learning together.  
* **Work openly** — Be transparent, welcome others in, and keep changes easy to follow. We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) to keep history clear.  

### Principles of Review

* Respond with clarity and curiosity  
* Offer suggestions, not judgments  
* Stay open to learning from each other  
* Treat reviews as shared practice

### Joining the Community

If you’re new, don’t worry — you don’t have to figure it out alone. Reach out to a member when making your first contribution. There’s no formal mentorship program, but informal support and pairing are common here. We learn and grow together.
